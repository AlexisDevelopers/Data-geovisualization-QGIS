Here we will work with 3 exercises in the QGIS geovisualization software:

EJERCICIO 1:

    In the documentation folder, we have the following layers loaded:
        ➢ Cartography of Madrid:
            o Neighborhoods for the municipality of Madrid
            o Districts for the Community of Madrid

    What we will do from the layers listed above is to generate the following maps:
        ➢ Map of the municipality of Madrid in which we represent:
            o The outline of the municipality of Madrid.
            o The districts of the municipality of Madrid.
            o The neighborhoods of the municipality of Madrid.
            o The centroids of the neighborhoods.
            o The name of the districts.

        ➢ Map of the Province of Madrid, in which we represent:
            o The municipality of Madrid.
            o The districts of the province.
            o The centroid of the districts.
            o The matrix of distances between the centroid of the municipality of Madrid, and the centroid of the rest of the districts.
            o Legend with distances

        ➢ In both cases the delivery will consist of:
            o GIS Project; in this project we will edit the names of the layers to make it self explanatory.
            o Auxiliary layers generated to carry out the exercise
            o Image of the Generated maps


EJERCICIO 2:

    ➢ This exercise consists of generating a project, with which we are going to generate the following maps, which will be accompanied by their respective legends:
        o Map of confirmed cases
        o Map of recovered cases
        o Map of deaths
        o Map that represents in a combined way, confirmed cases and deaths


EJERCICIO 3:

    The objective of this project is to tell a story based on data, for this we will work with the data from exercise 2:
        ➢ We will create a story with this data
        ➢ We can use the maps from exercise 2 or additional ones; the generation of new maps will be valued
        ➢ General a presentation with the results
